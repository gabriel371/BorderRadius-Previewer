# BorderRadius Previewer

A Flutter application that basically lets the user customize the BorderRadius of a Container. All its values can be changed and the result should show up in real time as the user edits its radius. A icon on top right corner leads the user to a dialog showing the updated code and long pressing over it will copy the code to clipboard.
